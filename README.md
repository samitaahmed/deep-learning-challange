#### Report on Neural network Model
----
##### Purpose:

The Purpose of the analysis is to develop a tool that can help to select the applicants for fundng with the best chance of success in the ventures for Alphabet Soup.

##### Result Analysis
Based on the provided training results, it appears that the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 53.24% on the training data. The loss value at the end of training is approximately 0.6931.

##### breakdown of the training results:

Loss: 0.6931056380271912
Accuracy: 0.5323615074157715 (53.24%)
Explanation:

The "loss" value represents the value of the loss function (in this case, binary cross-entropy) at the end of the training process. Lower values of the loss function indicate better model performance.
The "accuracy" value is the accuracy of the model on the training data, expressed as a percentage. It indicates the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all training data samples.

After training, it's recommended to evaluate the model on the test dataset to get a more accurate representation of its performance. This will provide a better estimate of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data. Additionally, further model optimization and tuning may be necessary to achieve better accuracy and generalization.
- The type of APPLICATION is one of the following; T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10, and T19
- The application has the following CLASSIFICATION; C1000, C2000, C3000, C1200, and C2100.

#### Recommendation
to increase the accuracyy A good model to recommend is the Random Forest model because Random Forest are good for classification problems.
